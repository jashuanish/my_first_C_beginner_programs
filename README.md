This repository documents my very first journey into programming, starting with the C language. I chose C as my entry point because of its close-to-hardware nature, which provides a solid foundation for understanding how computers work at a lower level. My goal is to strengthen my fundamentals so that transitioning to higher-level languages becomes easier and more intuitive.

The focus of this repository is on the core concepts of C programming, including:

Control structures: loops and conditional statements.

Arrays and their role in storing and manipulating collections of data.

Iterative vs. recursive approaches to solving problems.

An introduction to pointers and memory addressing.

Working with structures (structs) and unions for handling complex data types.

Basic concepts of array mapping and how data is organized in memory.

Each program here reflects incremental learning, starting from the absolute basics and gradually exploring more advanced ideas. The intention is not just to write code but also to develop problem-solving skills and logical thinking, which are essential for growth as a programmer.

By working through these topics in C, I aim to build a strong programming mindset that can be carried forward into future projects and other languages. This repository is meant to serve as both a personal learning log and a reference for anyone beginning their own journey with C.
